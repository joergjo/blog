I'm a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft Germany helping customers to build AI and cloud native applications. I have more than 25 years of experience in the consulting and high tech industry and have been doing software development for over 30 years. 

This blog focuses on my favorite topics these days: Microsoft Azure, generative AI, Go, .NET, containers, and the Apple ecosystem.


### Pet projects

- [go-foundry-local](https://github.com/joergjo/go-foundry-local): There wasn't a Foundry Local Go SDK, so I built my own. Supports both macOS and Windows. 
- [kubeup](https://github.com/joergjo/kubeup): A Go webhook to receive and process Azure Kubernetes Service notifications from Azure Event Grid as CloudEvents.
